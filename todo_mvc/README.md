# TodoMVC in Gren - [Try It!](https://roaring-maamoul-19ebb0.netlify.app/)

## This is a port of [Elm TodoMVC](https://github.com/evancz/elm-todomvc) to the Gren programming language

All of the Gren code lives in `src/Main.gren` and relies on the gren-lang/html library.

There also is a port handler set up in `index.html` to store the Gren application's state in `localStorage` on every update.
